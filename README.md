<h3>Alpha Goals</h3>

1) A single navigable level, no enemies or obstacles but nearly finalised character controls

> A cube in the middle of a 7x7 grid able to move in any available direction following the players swipes

2) Clean code compiled by bite sized well-documented chunks as well as precise and pixel-perfect sprites

> Let's not repeat Nitrocity's sins
